# How to contribute

Thank you for contributing to this project.

We welcome bug reports and discussions about new function in the issue tracker, and we also welcome proposed new features or bug fixes via pull requests.

You should read these guidelines to help you contribute.

## Reporting a bug

Please raise bugs via the issue tracker. First, check whether an issue for your problem already exists.

When raising bugs, try to give a good indication of the exact circumstances that provoked the bug. What were you doing? What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? What logs or other material can you provide to show the problem?

## Requesting new features

Please request new features via the issue tracker. When requesting features, try to show why you want the feature you're requesting.

## Contributing code

### Before you startâ€¦

If you're thinking of fixing a bug or adding new features, be sure to open an issue first. This gives us a place to have a discussion about the work.

### Building the cics-bundle-maven project

You shouldn't need to build the cics-bundle-maven project unless you plan to contribute code. In normal use you will automatically reference the built plugin from Maven Central.

However if you do want to build this project, clone the repository and build `cics-bundle-maven/pom.xml`. Because this is a reactor module, all the children will also be built.

To build all projects and install them into the local Maven repository, run:

```sh
mvn install
```

### Licensing

All code must have an EPL v2.0 header. To save you the menial work of getting the header right, you can let the Maven build do so by using the `add-licences` profile:

```sh
mvn -Padd-licences process-sources
```

When you've run this, you'll find that new files have had headers added. Always check that you're happy with the changes this build has made.

### Signing your contribution
